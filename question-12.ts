//  12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let Names = ["muskan", "arisha", "areefa", "saba"];

for(let name of Names) {
console.log(`Hello, ${name}! would you like to learn some typescript today?`);
};
