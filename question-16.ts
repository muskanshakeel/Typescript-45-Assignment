// 16. More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.

// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

// • Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.

let moreGuest =["muskan","arisha","areefa"];
console.log("Great news! i found bigger dinner table");

//adding more guests
moreGuest.unshift("saba");

moreGuest.splice(moreGuest.length/2,0,"ayesha");

moreGuest.forEach(moreGuest =>{
